  <h2> Among Us</h2>
	<div  style="width:800px;">Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio <a href="https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Innersloth#:~:text=Innersloth%20is%20a%20Redmond%2C%20Washington%20-based%20video%20game-development,for%20Windows%2C%20macOS%2C%20Nintendo%20Switch%2C%20and%20mobile%20devices.">Innersloth</a>. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. It allows for cross-platform play, first being released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows later that year in November. The game was then ported to the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and will release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in December 2021. While the game was initially released in 2018, to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. The timing of the COVID-19 pandemic has also been credited with boosting the game's popularity. The game received positive reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay and setting but criticized for technical issues. In response to the game's popularity, a planned sequel, Among Us 2, was hastily announced in August 2020. However, it was canceled a month later and the team shifted its focus to improving the original game, which has over time inspired the creation of multiple internet memes, mostly related to the slang term sus (e.g., "Sussy Baka").

  <h2> Always Has </h2>
	<div  style="width:800px;">Let's start with August 2016, a time when the Tumblr social network had not yet been disastrously acquired by Verizon. A blog consisting of a single Photoshop image showed the digital marquee of a bus stop warning that the State of Ohio faced immediate calamity for no reason at all. The image proved amazingly popular because some people believed it was the clever work of hackers pulling off pranks.
  <br>
  Memes featuring Ohio being on the verge of destruction proliferated over the next few years, which brings us to a 2018 single-panel cartoon of a Russian cosmonaut and an American astronaut looking at Earth from space. In this crude drawing, which was posted to 4Chan in August 2018, the cosmonaut comes to the realization that the world is consumed by the United States: "Wait, it's all America?," to which the American astronaut replies: "Always has been," but at the same time preparing to shoot the cosmonaut with what we can only assume to be a space gun.
  <br>
  In late 2019, the big reveal was that the Earth is all Ohio in a version posted to Facebook and Twitter. By June 2020, the exploitable panel became more sophisticated, but the big reveal punchline remained.

  <h2> Woo Yeah </h2>
  <div style="width:800px;"> Woo Yeah Baby! That's What I've Been Waiting For is a phrase spoken excitedly by YouTuber Cr1TiKaL. It has turned into a reaction GIF and video and is particularly popular on Instagram and Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  On September 21st, 2020, YouTuber Cr1TiKaL uploaded a commentary video reviewing a children's toy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsW4npZ0bDk">Poopsie Slime Surprise</a>. At 3:54 in the video, Cr1TiKaL raises his arms in excitement and yells "Woo yeah baby! That's what I've been waiting for," responding sarcastically to the product being ready to excrete faux feces. In under two weeks, Cr1TiKaL's video gained over 2.2 million views. A clip of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAXZbfLzJUg">Woo Yeah Baby</a> segment uploaded to YouTube by sethandthecrew on September 26th has received over 180,000 views
  <br>
  <br>
  People began using Cr1TiKaL's reaction as an exploitable. On September 29th, content creator Chromastone10 posted a Call of Duty edit of Cr1TiKaL's reaction. An October 5th featured repost on iFunny garnered more than 42,000 smiles while a Twitter repost on October 7th received over 29,000 likes. On October 3rd, an edit posted by iFunny user OswaldTheLuckyRabbit was featured and accumulated over 77,000 smiles in five days.

  <h2> Polish Cow </h2>
  <div style="width:800px;"> Tylko Jedno W Głowie Mam are the opening lyrics of the song "Gdzie jest biały węgorz ? (Zejście)" by Polish musical artist Cyprian "Cypis" Racicki. The song exploded in popularity in July 2020 after it was included in various dancing videos, most notably a dancing cow dubbed Polish Cow.
  <br>
  <br>
  On October 19th, 2015, Polish artist Cypis published a song called "Gdzie jest biały węgorz ? (Zejście)" to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrxv0JNVtgY">YouTube </a>. In under five years, it has received over ten million views and 160,000 likes. The video gained over 3.2 million views from August 11th to the 27th.
  <br>
  <br>
  How the song spread is unclear, but a number of dancing videos set to it began appearing in mid-July 2020. On July 13th, 2020, a one hour loop of a cow dancing to the song's opening was uploaded by user Dejman, gaining over 100,000 views in under a month. On the same day, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCZIcFh17dc">dancing triangle </a> video with a loop of the opening of the song was uploaded by user chomik13, garnering over 460,000 views in the same period (shown below, right).
